ABSTRACT
                                     
Thyroid cancer, impacting the thyroid gland in the neck, demands precise diagnosis andit is a 
prevalent form of cancer that affects the thyroid gland, a vital component of the endocrine 
system. Early detection and accurate assessment of the severity levels of thyroid cancer are 
crucial for effective treatment planning. This paper focuses on implementing a CNN-based 
deep learning model capable of analyzing standard medical reports from patients to determine 
the severity levels of thyroid cancer. Here we use Flask web application thatserves as the userfriendly frontend, enabling seamless integration with the CNN algorithm. Users upload 
standard medical reports containing thyroid images through the interface, allowing Flask to 
securely transmit these reports to the CNN model for analysis. The CNN, renowned for its 
image recognition capabilities, processes the medical reports and predicts thyroid cancer 
severity levels. The results are presented clearly, empowering healthcare professionals to make 
timely and informed decisions for intervention and treatment. This paper contributes to 
advancing thyroid cancer detection through the power of CNNs
